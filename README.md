IRC Bot!
==========

Super simple app that sits in an IRC channel and logs all the messages.

Installation
------------

You need Ruby. Then install all the gems.
You also need to set up some environment variables so the bot knows where you want it to hang out.

To start the app locally, just run:

 â†’ foreman start

It's set up to run on Heroku. You need two different processes in order for it to work correctly: one that runs the app, and one that sits in the IRC channel.
